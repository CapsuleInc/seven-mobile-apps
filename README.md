# seven-mobile-apps

This repo is to support the bootcamp teams doing the 'Seven Mobile Apps in Seven Weeks' book. We will all share this repo, and make the necessary updates in it to provide a better experience for all of the bootcamp members.

There is a lot of info in the CONTRIBUTING.md file, please have a look at it before you spend to much time struggling with github and git.

## Principles

The purpose of the book is to learn the differnt approaches to creating mobiles apps.

It is not to:
* Learn how to install the software
* Debug and correct issues in the book or the soiurce code

The way we will be aproaching the book to improve the experience for everyone will be as follows:
* Each chapter will be owned by one person. It is thier accountability to go through the entire chapter, correct any issues in the supplied source code, provide guidance on installation where required and generally make it easier for your team mates to focus on the learning. This is to be completed, checked in and a pull request sumitted before the team starts the chapter. This does not include doing the exercises for your team mates, although if there are tip/tricks to doing the homework, that would be good to share.
* When everyone is busy with the chapter, please contribute as well to improve the repo both for your group, and the ones that follow.
* Please put your advice, instructions etc into a README.md file in the relevant directory. Use markdown formatting (if you don't know this, there's a nice guide on github).

For details on how to contribute, see the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
